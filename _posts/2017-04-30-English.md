Good afternoon, dear professors. 

It`s great honor to be here for the interview. 

My name is Tang Cong, a senior student of school of materials science and engineering at China University of Geosciences. 

I major in material chemistry. I am willing to seek for challenging life. Over the last three years, after ensuring being seldom problem on learning courses, I took part in several course contests and achieved some or less. When I was sophomore, I started to contact with the experimental work, especially in junior, I made an exploration on the preparation of phosphor materials by microwave assisted process, and an academic paper was achieved in April this year, finally. In my opinion, these experiences are most precious asset of my college life.
Though, I have broad interests in my major and scientific research, I cannot be competent to do things professionally owing to lack of ample knowledge and ability at present. So I think further study is still urgent for to realize self-value. I will definitely be grateful if the present teachers offer the chance to continue to further study and researcher in my favorite field. OK, that is all!
Thank you very much!
